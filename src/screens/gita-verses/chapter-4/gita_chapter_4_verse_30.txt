4.29. - 4.30. [Some sages] offer the prana into the apana; like-wise others offer the apana into the prana.  Having controlled both the courses of the prana and apana, the same sages, with their desire fulfilled by the above activities, and with their food restricted, offer the pranas into pranas.  All these persons know what sacrifices are and have their sins destroyed by sacrifices.
